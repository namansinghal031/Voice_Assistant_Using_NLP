# Voice_Assistant_Using_NLP
The goal of this project is to create a voice-activated assistant named Emory. Emory can respond to voice commands, search the web, open websites, tell the time, show your location, and log conversations in a MySQL database.
Emory uses various technologies for speech recognition, text-to-speech, and a user-friendly graphical interface. This guide will outline the problem, approach, and tools used to build Emory, making it easy to understand and replicate.

# Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to develop a voice-activated personal assistant named Emory that can respond to voice commands, perform web searches, open web pages, provide current time and location, and log conversations into a MySQL database. The application will be built using Python and will feature a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use.The goal of this project is to develop a voice-activated personal assistant named Emory that can respond to voice commands, perform web searches, open web pages, provide current time and location, and log conversations into a MySQL database.

Speech Recognition: For converting speech to text.<br>
Datetime: For handling date and time operations.<br>
Wikipedia: For searching Wikipedia.<br>
Web Browser: For opening URLs in the default web browser.<br>
Requests: For making HTTP requests to fetch current location.<br>
MySQL Connector: For connecting to and interacting with the MySQL database.<br>
